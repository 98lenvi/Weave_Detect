# WIP Weave_Detect

I have uploaded the models that will differntaite between three types of weaving, i.e. Simple, Twill and Satin.
The files can be plugged into Tensorflow for poets 2, to make an android/iOS app to detect types of weaving.
The dataset used for training is not very good, and the effects can be seen when using the model.
